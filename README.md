A password is a secret set of characters that is used for user authentication to get access to a computer system or an application.
A strong password is a combination of alphabets, numbers, and special characters. And it should be at least 8 characters long. The longer the password, the stronger it is.
Hackers can easily crack a weak password using brute force attacks. So, it is important to create a strong password.
The password generator program we are going to see in this tutorial will generate a strong password every time you run it.
